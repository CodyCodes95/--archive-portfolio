          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Cody, im 26 years old from Warwick, Australia. I have always had a passion for technology and the web from a young age. After finishing school in 2013 I went full time at the job I had since I was 14, McDonald's. I worked in every role the business has to offer eventually ending up as the Operations Supervisor for 2 stores, Warwick and Stanthorpe.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am still unsure what took me so long to pursue a career in something that I was really passionate about, but something clicked late 2021, which made me drop everything and focus on joining the Coder Academy Web Development bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spend most of my free time working with either my own or friends' cars. I have built many award winning show cars over the last 5 years, with my current pride and joy being my BMW M3.

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>
            My professional skills mostly fall under business management, which at first glance may not seem to apply to a career in programming. But the skills like working with people, time management, task completion and many more, are all things which I've already noticed applying to programming. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Coding wise, my specific interests lie with Javascript, and I'm excited to learn more! Since my time at Coder, I have learned HTML and CSS, enough so to be able to build this website!
