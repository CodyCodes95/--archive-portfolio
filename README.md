**About**

This is my portfolio website as I pursue a career in web development. It's purpose is to show potential employers everything they would need to know in the recruitment phase, by sharing a bit about me, my skills, past projects, and how they can contact. The website is built using HTML, CSS and deployed through Netlify. 

The website was built with a mobile first approach to design and features a responsive design to accomodate all form factors. Some other features include a interactive nav menu for mobile users, a in browser PDF viewer for desktop, and just a touch of zany animations and other CSS effects sprinkled throughout for a bit of fun.

The target audience is any and all potential employers. Attached below are some screenshots showing off the responsive design on different devices, as well as the initial site map that was conceived before writing code for the website.

The tech stack used for the website development was HTML, CSS and Javascript.
